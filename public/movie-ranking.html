<H1>THE BEST MOVIES...<br>
According to Sabrina</H1>
<H2>TOP MOVIES OF ALL TIME:</H2>
    <HR>
 <H3>PRIDE AND PREJUDICE</H3>
   <P>The best romance movie of all time! Showcasing the story and love of two worlds colliding and creating a book (and movie) that never ages. Set in the English country side during the Regency period. Whats not to love?</P>
 <H3>SCHINDLERS LIST</H3>   
   <P>Based on the true story and moral and physical hardships of Oskar Schindler and the 1,100 Jews saved during the Nazi regime. Fantastic story about the will to live and the importance of doing the right thing, even when there might be severe consequences to your actions.</P> 
 <H3>SPIRITED AWAY</H3>   
   <P>Beautiful animation and a great story. 10/10. If you dont like it, something is wrong with you, not the movie. LOL </P>
